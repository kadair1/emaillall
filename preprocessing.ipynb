Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   \\n\\nIf you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval.

BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services.  I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator).\\nCall me if I've got this wrong or if we need to discuss further.   \\n\\nThx,\\n\\nDavid\\n3-6847\\n\\n  </body>\"},\n",

If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.\\n\\nAssuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:\\n\\n1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440\\n\\nSo at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.\\n\\nShorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.</body>'},\n",

Our theory is that something happened between FSP and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what happened, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our systems are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a huge P&L hit to the STNW book.

I don't think assuming that you give away 100% of the value you derive from not paying taxes at the LLC level +  still having to deduct your ADIT from rate base makes a lot of sense.  There should be some middle point here.  I could be wrong however.  The reason I ask is that if we assume both TW and NNG are C-Corps and we need to make the earnings per common unit accretive (leaving aside the fact that the CASH distritbution per unit is very accretive), this may not work.
